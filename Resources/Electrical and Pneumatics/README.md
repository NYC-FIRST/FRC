# Electrial and Pneumatic Resources

## General Electrical Resources
1. Watch video on how Circuits and Motors Work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWulQ1ZSE3c 
1. Watch video on what is a Motor Controller, H Bridge Circuit, PWM: https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/instruments-controls/dc-motor-controllers/
1. Watch video about Robot Wiring Basics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebf53bAnPY 
1. Watch video about Using Ferrules to make wiring connections easier: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=oN-tps_HEj0
1. Watch video about Robot Battery Basics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfxEauZMQqk
1. Watch video about Controller Area Networks. It is important to understand the basics of how the robotics components are communicating with each other. This video goes into extensive detail and it is ok to not completely understand the technical details. Watch at least the first few sections (4-5 mins of the video) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_y65h68z3U
1. Read the FRC Safety Manual which includes many sections on electrical safety: https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/team-resources/safety/2015/frc-team-safety-manual.pdf

## FRC Electronics Circuit Simulator
Using the knowledge learned about wiring FRC electrical and pneumatic components, digitally assemble all electronics components using the TKO Electronics Simulator. As announced on [Chief Delphi](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/frc-electronics-circuit-simulator-for-electronics-diagramming-and-training/389622), this tool wasa created by members of FRC Team TKO 1351. Shout out to 1351's members of TKO Programming: Rohan Bansal and Andy Li.

First, install the program by following the instructions listed on GitHub: https://github.com/MittyRobotics/tko-electronics-sim#installation

For this challenge, add the following parts and assemble them with the correctly colored and gauged wires, pneumatics tubing, and ethernet cables:
1. 1x Battery and Main Breaker Switch
1. 1x PDP, PCM, and VRM
1. 1x RoboRio and Radio
1. 4x Spark MAX controlling 4x NEO motors
1. 2x Talon controlling 2x 775 motors
1. 2x Falcon motors
1. 1x compressor and 2x air tanks
1. The appropriate number and placement of pressure switches, regulators, and relief valves
1. 2x soleniod controlling 2x pistons.

Correctly wire all components and ensure that all components are highlighted green with no errors.
